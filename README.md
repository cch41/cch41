# Hi, I'm Connor

I'm a software engineer in New York City. I graduated from Duke University in 2019 with a double major in Public Policy and Chinese, and a minor in Economics. While a part-time student in my Senior spring, I began reading about a variety of unexplored interests and ended up becoming fascinated by computers and software in particular. After graduating I moved to Chicago to work as an Associate for L.E.K. Consulting, a global management consuling firm. My interest in programming grew as I worked through a variety of MOOCs on weekends and continued to see the power and utility of software in some of my casework.

I began seriously considering a career switch, and conducted my own research in addition to speaking with friends in the tech industry and alumni of various coding bootcamps. After about a year and a half with L.E.K., I decided to fully transition into software engineering and left to enroll in App Academy's immersive 24-week online coding bootcamp. While attending I was able to learn about and gain experience working with a plethora of relevant industry languages, frameworks, and tools (detailed below) while also garnering a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals. Feel free to reach out if you share these interests or are interested in working together!
